I am currently dedicating most of my time at the moment to learning a few languages (C++, Rust, Python) and the basic principles of Cyber Security.
Currently attending university for Computer Science with a focus on Software Development.

I am in the process of full-stack developing a FOSS Voice/Text chat application on top of the Matrix protocol.
